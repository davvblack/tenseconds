You think he stole something, so you move in to attack.  He is very angry, but will tire quickly.  Block his wild attacks until he calms down, then cut him down."],

He practices his blocking moves against you, but isn't very good at timing them.  Don't attack into a block or you will be staggered and deal less damage for a few seconds."],

However, he's still a zen master so he's probably not going to attack you.  To use a power attack to penetrate his blocks, repeatedly stack the same type of attack on the same icon."],
["Turtle Man,",200,300,0,2,2,0.5,4,0,-0.125,0.6,0.4,0,0.6,0.4,0,"A large oafish man slowly moves towards you.  It's going to take many strokes to cut through all of that body weight, he should probably go to the gym more often.  It would also help him win sword fights."],
